Hi.

	Abandonment is a clause in property insurance policies prohibiting the insured from abandoning damaged property to the insurer for repair or disposal. Arranging for repair or disposal is the insured's responsibility, unless the insurer elects otherwise. The accident year is any 12-month period for which losses from incidents taking place during that 12-month period are tracked. Accident year experience is calculated by adding the total losses from any incidents occurring in that 12-month period. Two other cost accounting terms used in sorting loss experience are calendar year and policy (underwriting) year. Planned retention is a risk financing term referring to retention of losses by an organization as a result of a conscious decision. The organization is aware of the loss and exposure and makes a decision to assume the exposure. Effective date is the date on which an insurance binder or policy goes into effect and from which time protection is provided. Electronic data liability is the exposure faced by individuals and organizations that may cause loss of, damage to, or inability to access or use electronically stored data.
	In the financial world, risk management is the process of identification, analysis and acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decisions. Essentially, risk management occurs any time an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment and then takes the appropriate action (or inaction) given his investment objectives and risk tolerance. Risk management occurs everywhere in the financial world.
