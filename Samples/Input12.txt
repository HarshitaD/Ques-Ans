The Supreme Court today paved the way for the declaration of results of a national examination which would decide the fate of around 12 lakh students seeking to join medical and dental colleges across the country. The apex court stayed a May 24 interim order of the Madras High Court which had restrained the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) from publishing the results of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) of 2017. 

The top court said it was inclined to grant a stay on the high court's order which was indirectly "diluting" the schedule for NEET 2017 earlier fixed by the apex court. A vacation bench comprising Justices P C Pant and Deepak Gupta directed the authorities concerned to proceed with the process of announcing the results, subsequent counselling and admission as per the schedule fixed by the apex court.
